# Quantum-state-visualizer
The Quantum State Visualizer (QSV) is an interactive tool that simulates multi-qubit circuits and visualizes quantum states in 2D/3D. It supports Bloch spheres, density heatmaps, entanglement graphs, and circuit playback with gate highlighting, making quantum computing intuitive and explainable.
